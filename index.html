    <h1>Making a Trading Bot with ChatGPT Just COPY & PASTE </h1>
    <p>ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ READ ME! : I've received messages from people who didn't fund the contract with enough Ethereum to cover gas fees and possible burn fees. The bot targets token contracts with max 10% burn fee and anything lower. However, nowadays most tokens come with 2~6% fees. If you fund the contract with 0.4 ETH or less, and the bot targets another token with high burn fees, the contract will waste a lot of gas fees. I recommend funding the contract with at least 0.5 ~ 1 ETH to make sure that won't happen.ðŸš¨ðŸš¨.</p>
